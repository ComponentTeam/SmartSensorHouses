# Course Project
_Single-page Applications with Angular 2_

This document describes the **course project assignment** for the [Single-page Applications with Angular 2](telerikacademy.com/courses/courses/Details/391) at Telerik Academy.

## Project Description

Design and implement a **Single-page application** using [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)

It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application by your choice.

The application should have a:

- **public part** (accessible without authentication)
- **private part** (available for registered users)

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.
This public part could be the application start page, application statistics, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (Registered users area)

**Registered users** should have personal area in the web application accessible after **successful login**.
This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

## Technical Requirements

Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:

- At least **8 different public dynamic web pages**
- At least **7 different private (authenticated) dynamic web pages**
- At least **10 different** partial components
  - Partial, as not a whole page
- Responsive UI with good UX
- Most of the data should be loaded from a web server
  - You can use Firebase, parse.com, Telerik Back-end Services, or any other
  - You can use your own server written on Node.js, ASP.NET, or any other framework
- Load all data using services
- Use animations
- Create at least **3 different pipes**
- Create at least **3 different directives**
- Setup and use tslint
- Use **TypeScript**
- Use the **best practices** for software development and Object-oriented design
- Use Dependency Injection

##  General Requirements

- Use Git
  - Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, or other
- Brief **documentation** of the project and the project architecture
  - As `README.md` file at the root of the github repository

### Deliverables

- Record a short video showcasing your application
  - ~1-2 minutes, just show the interesting features
  - Do not record register/login functionality, this is not interesting...
- Upload your application in the cloud
  - MS Azure, HerokuCloud, Amazon, all are fine
- Register your application at [Our Showcase System](http://best.telerikacademy.com)
  - Link to the live application
  - Link to the video
  - Link to the github repository

### Public Project Defense

Each team will have to make a **public defense** of its work in front of a trainer (for about 30 minutes), in which each of the team members will answer to the trainer's questions individually.

The public defense includes:

- Live **demonstration** of the developed web application (prepare sample data).
- Explain application structure and its back-end and front-end **source code**
- Show the **commit logs** in the source control repository to prove a contribution from all team members.
- May include a simple task for each team member
  - The task must be implemented immediately

### Give Feedback about Your Teammates

You will be invited to **provide feedback** about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc.
The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so **take it seriously** and be honest.

# Starting and running the project
*****************************************

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**
> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.ts`](/src/app/app.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
# --depth 1 removes all but one .git commit history
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter.git

# change directory to our repo
cd angular2-webpack-starter

# install the repo with npm
npm install

# start the server
npm start

# use Hot Module Replacement
npm run server:dev:hmr

# if you're in China use cnpm
# https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm
```
go to [http://0.0.0.0:3000](http://0.0.0.0:3000) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angular2-webpack-starter/
 ├──config/                    * our configuration
 |   ├──helpers.js             * helper functions for our configuration files
 |   ├──spec-bundle.js         * ignore this magic that sets up our angular 2 testing environment
 |   ├──karma.conf.js          * karma config for our unit tests
 |   ├──protractor.conf.js     * protractor config for our end-to-end tests
 │   ├──webpack.dev.js         * our development webpack config
 │   ├──webpack.prod.js        * our production webpack config
 │   └──webpack.test.js        * our testing webpack config
 │
 ├──src/                       * our source files that will be compiled to javascript
 |   ├──main.browser.ts        * our entry file for our browser environment
 │   │
 |   ├──index.html             * Index.html: where we generate our index page
 │   │
 |   ├──polyfills.ts           * our polyfills file

 │   │
 │   ├──app/                   * WebApp: folder
 │   │   ├──app.spec.ts        * a simple test of components in app.ts
 │   │   ├──app.e2e.ts         * a simple end-to-end test for /
 │   │   └──app.ts             * App.ts: a simple version of our App component components
 │   │
 │   └──assets/                * static assets are served here
 │       ├──icon/              * our list of icons from www.favicon-generator.org
 │       ├──service-worker.js  * ignore this. Web App service worker that's not complete yet
 │       ├──robots.txt         * for search engines to crawl your website
 │       └──humans.txt          * for humans to know who the developers are
 │
 │
 ├──tslint.json                * typescript lint config
 ├──typedoc.json               * typescript documentation generator
 ├──tsconfig.json              * config that webpack uses for typescript
 ├──package.json               * what npm uses to manage it's dependencies
 └──webpack.config.js          * webpack main configuration file


Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:3000/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production
npm run build:prod
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# make sure you have your server running in another terminal
npm run e2e
```

### run webdriver (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:update
npm run webdriver:start
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run webdriver:start
# in another terminal
npm run e2e:live
```

### build Docker
```bash
npm run build:docker
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application
